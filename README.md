# Sales Forecasting with LSTM

This project aims to forecast weekly sales data for different product categories in various stores using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The forecasts incorporate additional variables such as promotion status, store number, and product category.

## Project Structure

- **store-sales-time-series-forecasting.zip**: Directory containing the input data files.
- **.ipynb files**: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model training.
- **README.md**: This readme file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas 
- numpy
- tensorflow
- dask

## Performance Metrics

After training the LSTM model, the following performance metrics were obtained:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.08
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.09
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.29
R-squared (R2): 0.96
